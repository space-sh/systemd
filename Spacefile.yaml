    title: Manage systemd via file system
    desc: |
        Manage systemd services, timers, etc directly via filesystem,
        this makes it so that we can manage systemd on an offline OS
        which disk/sd card we have mounted.
service:
    _env:
        - root:
            value: ${root:-/}
            title: The filesystem root directory
            desc: |
                When mounted a sd card or similar set this to the mount point of the root partition.
    list:
        _info:

        _env:

            title: Add systemd service to file system
            desc: |
                This node will create a systemd unit service directly in the filesystem
                Since this node does not use systemd to do this it can be targeted
                towards a mounted external filesystem, e.g. a sd card.
